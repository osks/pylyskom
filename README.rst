pylyskom is a Python library for communicating with LysKOM servers

Background
----------

pylyskom was originally based on python-lyskom. The following files
originates from python-lyskom: kom.py, komauxitems.py, aux-items.txt
and make_komauxitems. Most of the changes since then comes from
httpkom's use of kom.py. Httpkom also built some wrappers (komsession)
around the kom.py code, to make it easier to use. Pylyskom was created
as an attempt to break out komsession and the modifications to kom.py
from httpkom.

Preparing a release
*******************

TODO: How do we update the documentation on github pages?

On master:

1. Update and check CHANGELOG.md.

2. Increment version number and remove ``+dev`` suffix
   (in ``pylyskom/version.py``).

3. Run tests locally with ``make test``. Test manually by using jskom.

4. Commit, push.

5. Check CI build/test results.

6. Tag (annotated) with ``v<version>`` (example: ``v0.1``) and push the tag::

       git tag -a v0.1 -m "Version 0.1"
       git push origin v0.1

7. Build PyPI dist: ``make dist``

8. Push to Test PyPI: ``twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*`` and check
   https://test.pypi.org/project/pylyskom/ .

9. Push to PyPI: ``twine upload dist/*`` and check
   https://pypi.org/project/pylyskom/ .

10. Add ``+dev`` suffix to version number, commit and push.


Tools
*****

Install and update release tools with::

    pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel pip twine

Twine is used for pushing the built dist to PyPI. The examples in the
release process depends on a ``.pypirc`` file with config for the pypi
and testpypi repositories.

Example of ``.pypirc``::

    [pypi]
    username = __token__
    password = pypi-...

    [testpypi]
    repository = https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
    username = __token__
    password = pypi-...
